	abstract		= {On the Norwegian Continental Shelf there are many fields and wells in late life production. There are also many nearby drilling targets with limited volumes to add. This situation requires new mindset in order to optimize tie-ins of new reserves to existing infrastructure. Retrofit multilateral well solutions are regarded as one enabeler in this context since they enable tie-in to existing producers from nearby targets through deep sidetrack operations.  There are many pre-requisites that must be in place for such solutions to be suitable. In addition, the risk of partial success involves loss of an existing producer.  A few such wells have been constructed by the operator in the last couple of years. The requirements and challenges are discussed. The implementations show that it is technically feasible to use conventional multilateral technology in ways that enable installation in producing wells. Improvements to existing solutions are sought in order to facilitate future implementations and to improve robustness of this technology.}

	abstract		= {This paper presents \& the results of a study showing that the most harmful polycrystalline-diamond-compact (PDC) bit vibrations can be attributed to a phenomenon called ``bit whirl.'' During whirl, the instantaneous center of rotation moves around the face of the bit, and the bit whirls backward around the hole.  Cutters on a whirling bit can move sideways, backward, and much faster than those on a true rotating bit.  The impact loads associated with this motion cause PDC cutters to chip, which, in turn, accelerates wear. Laboratory and field results show the detrimental effects of whirl on PDC bit rate of penetration (ROP) and life.}

	abstract		= {A mathematical model has been developed for the drilling action of a tricone bit which gives quantitative predictions for torque, given the bit geometry and the force/penetration relationships for the individual indentors. The results of the model are substantiated by a number of laboratory experiments conducted on a fully instrumented bit. Using this device the details of the indentor motion can be analysed and the forces acting on certain of the indentors can be obtained while drilling. The detailed mathematical model can be simplified to a field interpretation model in which the torque response is described in terms of a contribution from the gouging action of the bit teeth and a contribution associated with the indenting action of the teeth.}

	abstract		= {On top of the abyssal plains of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone (CCZ) in the Pacific Ocean lie trillions of polymetallic nodules that contain many of the metals needed for transitioning to a low carbon future. In 2021, the pre-protype seafloor nodule collector ‘Patania II’ performed successful in-situ trials at 4,500 m ( \\&gt; 14,750 ft) water depth. The trials entailed collecting nodules using a hydraulic collector head and were complemented by an extensive environmental monitoring program. The gathered results will feed directly into a Seafloor Nodule Collector (SNC) and collector head design iteration study aimed at further improving performance. This paper presents the initial results of the Seafloor Nodule Collector improvement study using Computational Fluid Dynamics ({CFD}). The scope of the study is twofold, firstly the collector head design is improved and secondly, the wake behind the SNC is minimized. The combination of field experience and data with high-fidelity {CFD} simulation technology will result in a reliable impact prediction of the design improvements to be done. This paper will provide a useful methodology and reference for further design improvements for seafloor nodule collector vehicles, not only to enhance the hydraulic performance but also to reduce the environmental impact of deep-sea mining operations. Key performance indicators are being identified that contribute to sediment plume dispersion.  First, with respect to the collector head, the collector performance is influenced by its geometry, the jet- and surrounding water inflow and forward speed. The combination of these factors will create a pressure profile on the seafloor, which allows nodule pick-up and hydraulic transport. The trials showed that the balance between performance, robustness and unwanted water/sediment intake is impossible to determine in lab conditions. The in-situ gathered performance data, like pick-up efficiencies related to jet velocities, was used to validate {CFD} simulations and establish a reliable collector head numerical model. Based on measurement data and {CFD} results, a seafloor pressure profile base-case has been defined. A step-by-step approach was followed by simulating several modifications to the collector head geometry, by varying the jet flow and by applying recirculation of the discharge water to the suction head. This was carried out while consistently maintaining the base-case pressure profile as a reference. The modified numerical model shows that it is feasible to re-circulate and re-use a significant amount of sediment-laden jet water, while maintaining the pick-up performance and reliability. The set-up allows controllability on the amount of re-circulation. The obtained re-circulation results in a significant increase of sediment density, in combination with a decrease of diffuser outlet flow. This will improve the diffuser discharge characteristics and further reduce the sediment plume and associated environmental impact.  Secondly, a {CFD} study for wake modelling has been performed on Patania II as a base case. An optimization study was performed, which involved improving the SNC geometry and diffuser location with the aim to reduce the turbulence behind the vehicle and consequently reduce local sediment dispersion and related environmental impact.}

	surface weight on bit (SWOB) or differential pressure outputs, shows significant regional variation.  This range in
	dynamics poses a robustness challenge for automated drilling control systems. Many factors influence drilling dynamics
	such as pipe stiffness, mud properties, tortuosity, friction, bit design,\&BHA geometry. A simple analytic model representing
	axial drilling dynamics is described and compared to a finite element drilling model and to drilling data. The analytic model
	shows that axial drilling dynamics may be represented by a first-order transfer function with a time constant dependent on axial
	stiffness and drillabillity.}

	abstract		= {The parallel track scraping principle of conventional PDC bits largely limits the cutting efficiency and working life in deep formations. Cross-cutting polycrystalline diamond compact (PDC) bit may be an efficient drilling tool that increases the rock-breaking efficiency through both cross-cutting and alternate-cutting modes of the PDC cutter. The motion track equation of the cross-cutting PDC bit was derived by using the compound coordinate system, and the motion track was analyzed. Meanwhile, through the unit experiment and discrete element simulation, the cutting force, volume-specific load, and crack propagation were analyzed under different cutting modes. Through establishing a nonlinear dynamic model of the bit-rock system, the speed-up mechanism of the novel bit was analyzed based on rock damage, rock stress state, and motion characteristic of the bit during the rock-breaking process. Compared with unidirectional cutting, cross-cutting produces less cutting force, more brittle fracture, and a greater decrease of formation strength. The novel PDC bit can put more rock elements into a tensile stress condition than a conventional PDC bit, and the plastic energy dissipation ratio of the cross-cutting PDC bit is lower while the damage energy consumption ratio is higher than they are for conventional bits, which is beneficial to increasing the ratio of fracture failure and improving rock-breaking efficiency. Laboratory drilling tests show that the cross-cutting PDC bit can create mesh-like bottom-hole features. Drilling contrast experiments show that a mesh-like bottom-hole pattern can be obtained by using the cross-cutting PDC bit, of which the ROP is obviously higher than that of the conventional bit when drilling in sandstone or limestone formation. Meanwhile, the influence of deviation angle, weight on bit, and rock properties on cutting efficiency of the cross-cutting PDC bit are studied.},
